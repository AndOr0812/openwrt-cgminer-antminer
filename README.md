openwrt-cgminer-antminer
========================
This is the openwrt package for cgminer with antminer driver. You need to git clone the source code from https://github.com/bitmaintech/cgminer and put it in src folder. I don't know how to write the Makefile as in Makefile_old which download the source automatically from git.

There is a problem, when run cgminer as a daemon, it will use 100% cpu. Hope anybody can revise this.

The compiled firmware for GL-iNet smart router can be download from http://www.gl-inet.com/w/?lang=en

A guidance to use this firmware is here: http://www.gl-inet.com/w/?p=336&lang=en
